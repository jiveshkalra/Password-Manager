## Usage

To use the Password Manager, follow these steps:

2. Save Password: After generating the key, you can use option 2 to save a password for a website. Provide the password, website, email, username, and any other relevant information as input.

3. List Websites and Retrieve Password: Use option 3 to list all the websites for which you have saved passwords and retrieve the passwords. This will display the websites along with their corresponding passwords and any additional information you provided.

4. Exit: Option 4 allows you to exit the program.

Remember to keep your generated key secure, as without it, your passwords won't be accessible.
